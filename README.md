### Evangelion-like Alert System

#### Synopsis

* The intent of this codebase is to introduce a new visual system of warning and indications for web-applications.
* This visual system will attempt to create an informed warning and alert system for the user who is often placed on a subservant position of understanding.
* A view of the future was created in the animated series entitled [Neon Gensis Evangelion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon_genesis_evangelion) directed by [Hideaki Anno](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideaki_Anno) for which I'm using the visual language of as a jumping off point.
